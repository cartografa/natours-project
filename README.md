# Natours Project üçÉ

This is a landing page built for _Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!_ course by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

Is it full of silly animations that doesn¬¥t add any meaning to the UX at all? Well, **YES**. 

Is the general design a bit outdated and also the layout built without using flexbox or grid? Also **YES** 
(at least it was interesting to see how all of those calcs were involved in the *not so* old days).  

Have I learnt A LOT despise all of these things? Of course **YES**!

The project was built using Sass. It is responsive (but it was made with a desktop-first approach), all the features are 100% CSS.
